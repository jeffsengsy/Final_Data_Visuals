My Streamlit app was on visualizing crime in the city Chicago. 
The data is taken from an open data source in Chicago's city portal. https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/data_preview
The csv needed is a table with the listed areas and comunnity number
The data is pulled via API using Socrata

This app can have many different use cases;
People interested in looking to relocate to Chicago and do an analysis of different neighborhoods
Business owners looking to open a physical building 
Tourist looking for timing their visits to the city
